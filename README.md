Vision Statement: 
We will create the official Pokémon card game using the TCGDex API for card stats and abilities. We plan to use a gacha system to collect cards, which the user will then use to create a deck and face increasingly harder robots. They can also save their progress by logging in, which we will incorporate with help from the previous project. Lastly, we will use the Giphy API for humorous effect and the Faker API for our robot's names.
